Why use trees ?

1. Stores hierachical information
2. Trees (with some ordering e.g., BST) provide moderate access/search (quicker than Linked List and slower than arrays).
3. Trees provide moderate insertion/deletion (quicker than Arrays and slower than Unordered Linked Lists).
4. Like Linked Lists and unlike Arrays, Trees donâ€™t have an upper limit on number of nodes as nodes are linked using pointers.
